 + Composition of an error message:
  - Error in [./filefolder] class [x] - inline template:[#]:[#] caused by: [Cause of error]

 + Sourcemaps: Chrome's way of allowing the JS to be mapped into our TS files so we may debug inside the devtools.

 + You can also access the TS files through the [.] folder. This is found in the sources tab, under the wepack cloud.
