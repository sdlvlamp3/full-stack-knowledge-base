# ANGULAR TERMS:

1. Angular:     A Javascript framework that allows you to create reactive Single-Page-Applications (SPA's)

2. SPA:    An app composed of one file the user receives. The server will send the client ONE Html file that can dynamically change using Javascript. Creating a SPA allows a very interactive experience and much faster loading times. The website will look and feel like a native mobile app.

3. Angular Versions:    There are 2 major Angular versions, Angular 1 (AngularJS) and Angular 2+. Angular 2 and beyond is a complete rewrite entirely different from AngularJS.

4. CLI:     Command Line Interface is a terminal that accepts text input to execute operating system functions.

5. Component:   A section or feature of your app. Every component has its own template, style and logic. The benefit is that they are reusable and controllable.

6. Data-Binding:    How we automatically update our pages template when our application state changes.

7. Event-Binding:   A one-way connection from the view/template to the data source/logic.

8. Two-Way-Binding:     When we connect the view/template to the source/logic, and when either of them changes, they update.

9.  Directives:      How we give instructions to the DOM to control certain elements in Angular.

10. Attribute Directive:    What we use to change the behavior or appearance of elements. (ngClass, ngStyle, ngModel)

11. Structural Directive:   Used to change the DOM layout by adding, removing, or altering elements. (@If, @For, ngSwitch)

12. Services:       In Angular, a service is a centralized store where you can place code so multiple other components can use it. Services allow apps to have better communication.
 
13. Dependency Injection:       When a class uses code from another class or service instead of writing it locally. You "inject" the code from one part of the app into another.

14. D.R.Y. Code:        "Don't Repeat Yourself" is a meta-programming philosophy that advises you to abstract away any logic you can use in multiple components to a shared place.

15.
