Components are the key feature in Angular. The entire application is made by composing it from a couple components which you create on your own.

We always start with the root component, which holds the entire application. We will nest other components inside it.

A typical website may contain a header with buttons, a main content area, and a sidebar.

Each of those items are a component in our code. Each component has its own HTML template, styling, own business logic. This allows the app to split into smaller, reusable components. Making it easier to replicate the business logic / styling without having to crunch everything into one file.
