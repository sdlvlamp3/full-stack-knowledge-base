Two Way Binding is the combination of event binding and property binding.

$event is a way to get event data, but there is another approach.

We combine the syntaxes to use Two Way Binding. [()]

We have to use a special directive called ngModel.

  This will trigger on the input event and update the value of the serverName in our componenet automatically.
