Angular:    JS framework which allows you to create reactive SINGLE-PAGE-APPLICATIONS (SPAs)

Why Angular?
      Uses only 1 html page that renders everything in the browser.
      This makes the web app faster and more responsive.
      JS is much faster than having to reach out to a server for every page change for every new piece of data you want to display.
      Angular creates SPA that is very reactive and very fast.
      The JS is running in the browser and not on the server, so it is much faster.
