Versioning:
    Started with Angular 1 (Angular JS)
    Was found that Angular 1 is not future proof, so they re-wrote it
    This made Angular 2

    Angular 2 is completely different, so angular 1 is irrelevant.

    Angular 3 was skipped, but Angular 4... 10... and so on.
    All versions are the same frameworks, but with new features and bug fixes.
    Has not changed too much since Angular 2 in regards to the code we write.
    Often referred to as just Angular.
