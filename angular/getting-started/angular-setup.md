Angular Command Line Interfrace (CLI)

    Use the official Angular CLI as Angular is a bit complex.
    Like other projects I have worked on, Angular will use node.js and npm to help organize and optimize the project.

On GitBash, run the following:

  1. npm install -g @angular/cli
  2. cd your way into where you want to create your file
      documents
       github
        full-stack-knowledge-base
         angular
          getting-started
  3.  ng new [file name] --no-strict
  4.  For now, choose no for angular routing.
  5.  Use CSS for the default styling.  
  6.  Use command ng serve to run a local server to see your project.
  7.  Go to http://localhost:4200/ to see your project.
