+ Terminology
  - JavaScript:      A high-level programming language used for creating dynamic and interactive web content.
  - Data types:      The classification of values in JavaScript, such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.
  - Variables:       Containers for storing and manipulating data in JavaScript.
  - Operators:       Symbols used for performing operations on values, such as addition, subtraction, and comparison.
  - Conditionals:    Statements that enable different actions based on certain conditions.
  - Loops:           Constructs that allow repeated execution of a block of code until a specific condition is met.

+ Data Types:
  - Specifies which type of VALUE each VARIABLE has and what type of mathematical, relational, or logical operation can be applied to it (without causing an error)

+ Operators:
  - Manipulate / evaluate an expression. 
    * +
    * -
    * \
    * *
    * &gt;
    * &lt;
    * ===
    * !==

+ Conditional Statement: 
  - A programming expression or command that instructs a computer to run code if a specified statement is truthy or not.

+ JS in External Files:
  - JS code is typically in an external file with ".js" extension.
  - It is also linked to the HTML using <script>

+ Basic Syntax and Structure:
  - JS consists of statements that are executed sequentially
  - Each statement ends with a (;) to indicate the end of a statement
  - Ex:
    * let x = 5;            // Initialize x variable
    * let y = 10;           // Initialize y variable
    * let sum = x + y;      // Calculate sum
    * console.log('The sum of x and y is: ' + sum); // Output sum
