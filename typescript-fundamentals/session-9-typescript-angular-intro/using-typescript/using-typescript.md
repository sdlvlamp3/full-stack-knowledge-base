In order to use TypeScript, we need to install it first. We can do this by running the following command in our terminal:
  npm install typescript

Next, invoke the TypeScript compiler.
  TS does not run in the browser. It needs to be compiled to JS first, meaning all of the TS annotations will be removed.

  To invoke the compilier, run the following command in your terminal:
    npx tsc OR npx tsc with-[filename.ts]
